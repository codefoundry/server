This is a project to create a CodeFoundry development server using Vagrant and
Chef.  This is handy because CodeFoundry relies on SVN hosting in apache;
running apache in a development VM is nice.

CodeFoundry is developed for ruby-1.9.2 and Vagrant boxes come with ruby-1.8.7
by default.  This creates problems when setting up the VM, so an additional
Vagrantfile (-ruby-1.9.2) is included.  To create a base box with 1.9.2, run
the following commands:

 $ ln -s Vagrantfile-ruby-1.9.2 Vagrantfile
 $ vagrant up
 $ vagrant package
 $ vagrant box add base-ruby192 /current/path/package.box
 $ vagrant destroy

Once the base-ruby192 box is created, you can bring up a CodeFoundry VM:

 $ rm Vagrantfile
 $ ln -s Vagrantfile-cf Vagrantfile
 $ vagrant up
